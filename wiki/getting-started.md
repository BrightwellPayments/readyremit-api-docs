# Introduction

The ReadyRemit Cloud Service performs [remittances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remittance) on cross-border [corridors](https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/en/countrycorridors). for [fintech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology) web, mobile/native, and single-page applications that access the ReadyRemit REST API described on this site.

## How to sign up

When you sign up to use the ReadyRemit Cloud Service, Brightwell provides you with the following:

* A unique set of credentials for each of your ReadyRemit client applications. These credentials consist of a client_id and a client_secret. Each client application uses these two values to call the Get Access Token operation.

* A unique senderId for each sender account you support. Each client application needs to pass a senderId to the Create Recipient and Get Recipients operations.
