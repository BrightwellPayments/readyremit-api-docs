This website describes the ReadyRemit Cloud Service, and explains to [fintech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology) application developers how to programmatically access the service via the ReadyRemit REST API. The service performs [remittances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remittance) on cross-border [corridors](https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/en/countrycorridors):

To become a ReadyRemit early adopter, browse to the <a href="https://brightwell.com/contact-us/" target="_blank">Brightwell Contact</a> page, scroll to the *Get in touch* form, type your name and email, choose *ReadyRemit* from the dropdown menu, add a comment, and click Submit. 

Once you sign up, Brightwell will provide you with the following:

1. A *client_id* and a *client_secret* for each of your ReadyRemit client applications. Each application passes these two values to the ReadyRemit REST API in return for an access token required by other API operations.

1. A unique *senderId* (required by certain ReadyRemit REST API operations) for each sender account you support.
